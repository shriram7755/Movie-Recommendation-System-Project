# Movie-Recommendation-System-Project

In this data science project, we aim to build a Movie Recommendation System that leverages collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system will analyze user interactions with movies and use that information to predict and recommend movies that the user might enjoy.

Objective:

The primary goal of the project is to create an intelligent movie recommendation system that enhances user experience by offering personalized movie suggestions. The system will be based on collaborative filtering, a popular technique that identifies similarities between users or items to make recommendations.
